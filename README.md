Paste
====
Just a very simple, un-styled, more of an example if anything, paste app.
You can paste data into the main page and it will be stored on a mongoDB that is configured.
It requires Python 3.5 and Flask.

Configure mongo by putting the URI in the Envrionment Variable 'MONGO_URI'.
```
export MONGO_URI=mongodb://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>
```
